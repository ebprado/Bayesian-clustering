# Bayesian clustering
In order to have a deeper understanding about some basic Bayesian clustering methods, such as Finite Mixture of Normals (FMN) and Product Partition Models (PPM), I decided to implement them in R as simple as possible so that I could grasp.

1 - The math is presented in the pdf document.

2 - The R scripts are ```FMN.R``` for Finite Mixture of Normals and ```PPM.R``` for Product Partition Models.
